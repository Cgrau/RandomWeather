# Code Challenge

## Description

The objective of this challenge is to display the weather of a random location defined by its latitude and longitude. In order to generate a random location, please take into account the requirements for valid latitude and a valid longitude.  
Weather information for a specific location can be obtained from the [http://openweathermap.org/current​](http://openweathermap.org/current​) API. The request will be done using the weather query by geographic coordinates: [https://openweathermap.org/current#geo​](https://openweathermap.org/current#geo​).

- You can use the following appId **​ae103060692fe13422deb98285505dc6​**
- If the appId above fails, it might have been deactivated or it might have expired. Feel free to use your own generated appId (generating one in OpenWeather is totally free), or contact us and we'll generate a new API key.

### Requirements

- You have **three days** to complete the challenge.
- The application will consist of one screen showing the weather for the **​current random location** ​obtained from the API. Try to display the information in a meaningful way.
- The latitude and longitude or the name of the city should be displayed too.
- There should be a way to refresh the content by displaying the weather of a new random location.
- Testing is important.
- Provide your code on this git repository.
- Please, include a README describing your solution.
